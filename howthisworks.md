# How Prism Works

Prism acts as a **discovery, management, and launch bridge** for Minecraft Bedrock content.

## Browsing Add-Ons

Prism retrieves add-on listings and metadata directly from **CurseForge** using their official API.

This includes:
- Add-on names and descriptions
- Versions and update information
- Creator-provided metadata

Prism does not host or alter this content.

## Installing & Managing Content

When you install an add-on:
- Prism tracks it locally as an installed item
- Minecraft handles the actual import and execution
- Prism does not modify or inject game files

## Launching Minecraft

Prism opens Minecraft using:
- Official iOS URL schemes
- System-level app handoff

This ensures full platform compliance and security.

## Updates & Notifications

Prism may notify you when:
- Installed CurseForge content has updates available
- News or featured content changes

All updates remain optional and user-controlled.

## What Prism Is Not

Prism does **not**:
- Modify Minecraft internally
- Bypass the Minecraft Marketplace
- Access your Minecraft or CurseForge account
- Run background services without permission
